# Quick Start Guide - Custom Product Image Upload Lite

## For Developers

### Activating Lite Version

To activate the lite version instead of pro:

1. **Deactivate Pro** (if active):
   - Go to WordPress Admin > Plugins
   - Deactivate "Custom Product Image Upload"

2. **Activate Lite**:
   - Activate "Custom Product Image Upload Lite"

The main difference is the file loaded:
- **Pro**: `custom-product-image-upload.php` (CPIU_IS_LITE undefined)
- **Lite**: `custom-product-image-upload-lite.php` (CPIU_IS_LITE = true)

### Key Code Locations

#### Version Detection
```php
// Check if lite version
if (defined('CPIU_IS_LITE') && CPIU_IS_LITE === true) {
    // Lite-specific code
}

// Or use helper function
if (cpiu_is_feature_enabled('multi_product')) {
    // Feature is available
}
```

#### Data Manager
- **File**: `includes/class-cpiu-data-manager.php`
- **Key Methods**:
  - `is_lite_version()` - Returns true if lite
  - `can_add_product()` - Returns false if lite and 1 product exists
  - `save_product_configuration()` - Blocks 2nd product in lite

#### Admin Interface  
- **File**: `includes/class-cpiu-admin-interface.php`
- **Key Methods**:
  - `render_upgrade_prompt($feature)` - Shows upgrade banner
  - Localized JS includes `is_lite`, `can_add_product` flags

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't add multiple products at once"
**This is expected!** Lite version supports only single product configuration. 

**Solution**: Upgrade to Pro for unlimited products.

### "Bulk operations disabled"
**This is expected!** Bulk operations are a Pro feature.

**Solution**: Upgrade to Pro or configure products individually.

### Upgrade prompts not showing
1. Check if `CPIU_IS_LITE` is defined in the main plugin file
2. Clear browser cache
3. Deactivate and reactivate plugin

### Settings not saving
1. Check WooCommerce is active
2. Check file permissions
3. Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
4. Verify nonce is not expired (reload admin page)

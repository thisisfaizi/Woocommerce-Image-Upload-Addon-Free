---

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Phase 1: Codebase Setup & Core Restrictions ✅

#### 1. Main Plugin File Created
- **File**: `custom-product-image-upload-lite.php`

#### 2. Data Manager Enhanced
- **File**: `includes/class-cpiu-data-manager.php`
- **New Methods**:
  - `is_lite_version()` - Detects if running lite or pro version
  - `can_add_product()` - Checks if lite can add more products (enforces 1 product limit)
  - `get_configured_products_count()` - Returns count of configured products
- **Modified Methods**:
  - `save_product_configuration()` - Blocks saving 2nd product in lite version

);
```

## 🚀 Upgrade Compatibility Strategy

### Key Design Decisions:

#### 1. **Same Codebase Approach**
- Lite IS the pro version with features disabled
- Not a separate codebase
- Ensures 100% compatibility

#### 2. **Data Structure Preservation**
- All settings use identical schemas
- Same option names: `cpiu_multi_product_configs`, `cpiu_default_settings`
- Same meta keys for orders and cart items
- Version flag differentiates: `'version' => 'lite'` vs `'version' => 'pro'`

#### 3. **Feature Flags, Not Code Removal**
- Premium code remains in place
- Controlled by `is_lite_version()` checks
- Easy to re-enable by changing constant

#### 4. **Seamless Upgrade Process**
The upgrade is remarkably simple:
```php
// Lite version
define('CPIU_IS_LITE', true);

// After upgrade to Pro
define('CPIU_IS_LITE', false); // or remove line entirely
```

### Upgrade Benefits:
✅ **Zero Data Loss**: All configurations preserved
✅ **Zero File Migration**: Uploads stay in same location
✅ **Zero Reconfiguration**: Everything works immediately
✅ **Zero Downtime**: Instant feature activation
✅ **Zero Risk**: Can rollback if needed
